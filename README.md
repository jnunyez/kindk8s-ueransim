# kindk8s-ueransim

a repo containing config maps and deployments of 5G-NR emulated networks in k8s 

## Rationale

This repo leverages [ueransim](https://github.com/aligungr/UERANSIM) to deploy 5G-NR in k8s using [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io).

## Quickstart


Deploy a 5G gnb Antenna and a 5G UE on k8s: 

   ```
   deploy-ueransim
